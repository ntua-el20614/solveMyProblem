ehat is the purpose of restart in this docker compose file?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In your Docker Compose file, the restart: unless-stopped directive is used to control the behavior of the Docker container when it stops or fails.

Here’s what it does:

restart: unless-stopped means that Docker will automatically restart the container if it stops unexpectedly (e.g., due to an error or crash). However, if the container is explicitly stopped by the user (for example, using docker stop), Docker will not attempt to restart it.
In summary, this ensures that the container will keep running even after crashes or reboots, unless the user manually stops it. This is useful for long-running services like a front-end app that you want to keep running without manual intervention.

I am running a python problem(the attached python file) but it crashes maybe because it uses all the resources from docker. can I make it to run in cloud(maybe google has something that can help me run solver on cloud)? 
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can definitely run resource-intensive Python programs, such as your solver, in the cloud. Google provides several services that are well-suited for running such workloads. Here are two key options from Google Cloud that might be suitable:

1. Google Colab (for free, but limited resources)
What it is: A free cloud-based environment for running Python code, often used for machine learning tasks but can be used for any Python program.
Pros: No setup required, easy access to GPUs/TPUs (for certain tasks), and no cost for basic use.
Cons: Limited compute power, session time limits, and restricted access to system-level customization.
How to use:
Upload your Python file to Google Drive or Google Colab.
Modify the code (if needed) to adapt to the runtime environment.
Run the code.
2. Google Cloud Compute Engine (for scalable cloud infrastructure)
What it is: A cloud service that allows you to create virtual machines (VMs) with custom resource allocation (e.g., more CPUs, RAM, GPUs).
Pros: Full control over the machine, scalable to meet your compute needs (i.e., you can choose how much CPU, memory, and disk storage to allocate), and can be integrated with Docker if needed.
Cons: Requires setup, costs depend on usage.
How to use:
Set up a VM on Google Compute Engine: Choose an instance with sufficient resources (CPUs, memory).
Install Docker (if needed): If you want to run your Python code within Docker, install Docker on the VM.
Deploy and run: Either copy your Python code or deploy it as a Docker container, then execute your solver.
Steps for using Google Cloud Compute Engine with Docker:
Create a VM in the Google Cloud Console.
SSH into the VM and install Docker:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
Copy your Python file or Docker project to the VM.
If your project uses Docker, you can build and run the Docker container in the cloud, similarly to how you run it locally:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t solver-image .
docker run solver-image
These options provide scalable ways to handle resource-intensive tasks like solving problems in Docker. Would you like to explore either of these options in more detail?

From your description, it looks like you're building a system where users can upload parameters and execute a Python solver in the backend, which processes the data and returns the result. Your current architecture involves RabbitMQ for task queuing and a backend service in solver.js that executes the Python script using exec().

Best Option for Running Python in the Cloud for Your Website
Given your goal, Google Cloud Compute Engine or Google Cloud Run would be the best options. Here’s why:

1. Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCE)
Why: Since you’re already familiar with Docker and running services in containers, using GCE to run a VM that can scale up to handle the Python processing might be a good fit. You can easily configure a Docker container with RabbitMQ and the Python solver, and deploy it on GCE.

Advantages:

Full control over the environment (Docker, Python dependencies, RabbitMQ, etc.).
Can handle resource-intensive tasks (e.g., allocating more CPU, RAM, etc.).
Scales to meet higher demands as needed (more tasks, heavier processing).
You can configure auto-scaling based on the number of tasks.
How it fits your architecture:

You could containerize both the solver.js script and the Python solver, and then deploy them to a Compute Engine VM.
The RabbitMQ queues and messages could be handled easily within this setup.
You can control the instance type and scale as needed when your users increase.
2. Google Cloud Run
Why: If you want to avoid managing a full VM or complex scaling, Google Cloud Run could work well. Cloud Run allows you to run Docker containers in a fully managed environment, scaling up and down based on demand.
Advantages:
No need to manage the infrastructure (VMs, OS, etc.).
Scales automatically based on the number of requests.
Pay only for the resources you use, making it more cost-effective for burst workloads.
You can deploy your existing Docker-based service (solver.js + RabbitMQ) in the cloud without any VM setup.
How it fits your architecture:
You can create a Docker image with your solver.js backend, RabbitMQ connection, and Python solver.
Deploy this image to Cloud Run, and it will automatically scale to handle your incoming tasks.
Cloud Run also integrates well with other Google Cloud services, and can be set to automatically trigger based on events (such as incoming tasks in RabbitMQ).
Choosing Between GCE and Cloud Run:
GCE gives you full control over your environment but requires manual scaling and more management (OS, Docker, etc.).
Cloud Run is more hands-off in terms of infrastructure management but may require refactoring to ensure it's stateless and fully containerized.
Since your current setup uses Docker and RabbitMQ, Google Cloud Run might be the simpler solution. You can package your existing setup into a container and deploy it without worrying about infrastructure.

Deployment Process for Cloud Run:
Containerize your app: Create a Dockerfile that includes solver.js, the Python environment for running the solver, and RabbitMQ connections.
Push to Google Container Registry: Once the image is built, push it to Google Container Registry.
Deploy to Cloud Run: Deploy the container to Google Cloud Run, and it will automatically scale and run based on the tasks being received.
Monitoring & Scaling: Cloud Run will scale automatically based on the number of requests (tasks), so you won't have to worry about handling too much traffic.
If you need guidance on containerizing your application or deploying to Google Cloud Run or Compute Engine, I can provide further details! Which approach do you think would suit your project best?

I dont care witch one i just dont want to pay because its a school project
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since your priority is not paying for the service, Google Cloud Run with its free tier or Google Colab would be the best options. Let me explain both, but I think Cloud Run will fit better with your current setup:

1. Google Cloud Run (Free Tier)
Why: Google Cloud Run offers a generous free tier, which might be enough for a school project, especially if you're not expecting a heavy load. It’s ideal for running containerized applications (like your solver.js + Python) without worrying about infrastructure management.
Free Tier Details:
50 vCPU-hours per month and 2 GiB memory-hours per month are free.
Automatic scaling, meaning you don’t need to pay when no tasks are running.
You only pay for what you use, and for school projects with light usage, you might not exceed the free tier.
How to set it up:

Containerize Your Application: You already seem to have a backend with solver.js and RabbitMQ. Package your app into a Docker container.
Deploy to Google Cloud Run:
Use the Google Cloud CLI to deploy your Docker container directly to Cloud Run.
It will scale down when there are no incoming tasks and scale up when users submit their parameters.
Free for Light Use: For a school project with occasional user inputs, you’re unlikely to exceed the free limits.
Steps:

Build a Docker image for your app (Dockerize the solver.js and Python environment).
Push the Docker image to Google Container Registry.
Deploy the container image to Google Cloud Run.
2. Google Colab (Free but Limited)
Why: If your project doesn’t involve constant requests or needs a more interactive experience, Google Colab offers a free Python environment in the cloud. It’s more suitable for running one-off jobs (e.g., processing a single set of parameters), but it has limited compute resources and time constraints.
How to Use It:
Upload your Python solver code to Google Colab.
Students or users could interact with the Colab notebook, upload parameters, and run the solver.
Limitations: Colab has limits on compute time (up to 12 hours per session) and requires manual interaction, so it’s not ideal for backend automation.
Best Fit for You: Google Cloud Run
Given that you're building a website where users can upload parameters and expect results asynchronously, Google Cloud Run is the better option. It allows you to automate the backend, scale, and most importantly, run within the free tier for light school project usage.

If you choose Cloud Run, I can help guide you through containerizing and deploying your app to Cloud Run for free usage. Would you like assistance with that?

To set up Google Cloud Run using your Docker Compose setup, you'll need to break the process into steps. Google Cloud Run doesn't directly support Docker Compose, but you can deploy each service as a container individually.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to deploying your microservices-based application to Google Cloud Run:

Prerequisites
Google Cloud account: Sign up if you don’t have one.
Google Cloud SDK: Install the SDK on your local machine from Google Cloud SDK documentation.
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed and working.
1. Set Up a Google Cloud Project
Create a new Google Cloud project:
bash
Copy code
gcloud projects create <your-project-id>
Set the project:
bash
Copy code
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
Enable necessary services:
bash
Copy code
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com
2. Containerize Each Microservice
You need to containerize each of the services from your docker-compose.yml file.

For example, for the solver-ms service:

Navigate to the solver-ms directory.

Create a Dockerfile if not already present. It might look something like this:

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port (if necessary)
EXPOSE 7000

# Set the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "vrpSolver.py"]
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms .
Push the image to Google Container Registry:

bash
Copy code
docker push gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms
3. Deploy to Google Cloud Run
Deploy the solver-ms service:
bash
Copy code
gcloud run deploy solver-ms \
  --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
This will deploy the service to Google Cloud Run and expose it via a URL.
Repeat these steps for each service (edit-view-run-ms, login-ms, view-results-ms, etc.), containerizing and pushing them to Google Container Registry and then deploying them to Cloud Run.
4. External Services (MongoDB and RabbitMQ)
For the services that are harder to containerize (like MongoDB and RabbitMQ), you can use Google Cloud alternatives:

MongoDB:
Use MongoDB Atlas (the cloud-hosted version of MongoDB) for your database needs. It offers a free tier, which is great for a school project.
Sign up for MongoDB Atlas and create a cluster.
Update your services to connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.
RabbitMQ:
RabbitMQ can be run inside Google Compute Engine (GCE) or you can try Cloud Pub/Sub (Google’s fully-managed message queuing system) as an alternative.
5. Testing and Integration
Once each microservice is deployed and the external services are configured, you can:

Test your microservices by accessing their respective URLs provided by Cloud Run.
Make sure that the services communicate as expected (e.g., RabbitMQ or Cloud Pub/Sub for messaging).
6. Setting Up Environment Variables
For each service, you’ll need to set the environment variables that are currently in your docker-compose.yml file.

You can pass environment variables when deploying to Google Cloud Run:
bash
Copy code
gcloud run deploy solver-ms \
  --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars RABBITMQ_URL=<your-rabbitmq-url>
Repeat this for any environment variables needed by your services.
7. Monitor Costs
While Google Cloud Run has a free tier, monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges. Google Cloud provides budget alerts that you can set up to be notified if usage exceeds the free tier.

Summary
You’ll be:

Containerizing each service using Docker.
Pushing the images to Google Container Registry.
Deploying the services to Google Cloud Run.
Using MongoDB Atlas and RabbitMQ/Cloud Pub/Sub for external services.
This approach allows you to run your project at no cost, provided you stay within the free tier limits. Would you like to proceed with a particular part of the setup? Let me know if you need further details on any step!

Do i need to push all the images to google cloud? The only one that i need to run on cloud is solver but solver interacts with other microservices
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you only want to run the solver-ms service on Google Cloud Run and keep the other microservices running locally or on another platform, that's possible, but you’ll need to ensure that the solver-ms service can communicate with your locally hosted microservices. Here's how you can handle this:

Key Considerations
Solver on Cloud, Other Services Locally: Since solver-ms interacts with other microservices (e.g., RabbitMQ, MongoDB), you need to make sure the solver-ms service running on Google Cloud can access those services hosted locally or elsewhere.

Publicly Accessible Endpoints: Google Cloud Run services run in a secure cloud environment, which means the other services (like rabbitmq, mongo, and the front-end) need to be accessible over the internet (i.e., they must be exposed via a public IP or domain).

Exposing Locally Running Services: If the other microservices remain local, you’ll need to:

Expose them to the internet using port forwarding or tools like ngrok.
Configure the solver-ms service to interact with these public endpoints.
Steps to Run Only solver-ms on Google Cloud Run
1. Expose Locally Running Microservices (RabbitMQ, MongoDB, etc.)
If RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and other services are running locally (or in Docker containers locally), you need to make them publicly accessible.
You can use tools like ngrok to expose local services over the internet securely.
Example: Exposing RabbitMQ and MongoDB using ngrok:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5672  # For RabbitMQ
ngrok http 27017 # For MongoDB
This will give you public URLs (e.g., https://xxxx.ngrok.io) that your solver-ms service on Google Cloud Run can use to communicate with these local services.

2. Modify Environment Variables in solver-ms
Update the environment variables in solver-ms to point to the public URLs of the services you exposed using ngrok or other methods.
Example (if using ngrok URLs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB):

bash
Copy code
gcloud run deploy solver-ms \
  --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars RABBITMQ_URL=https://xxxx.ngrok.io \
  --set-env-vars MONGO_URL=https://yyyy.ngrok.io
3. Deploy solver-ms to Google Cloud Run
Once the other services are publicly accessible, you can deploy the solver-ms service to Google Cloud Run.
Ensure that you pass the correct URLs for RabbitMQ and other microservices (as shown above) so that solver-ms can communicate with them.
4. Run and Test
After deployment, test the solver-ms service on Google Cloud Run by triggering the message queue (RabbitMQ) and verifying that solver-ms receives and processes the message correctly.
5. Optional: Move Other Services to Cloud (if needed later)
If exposing local services becomes too complex or unreliable, you can eventually move the other services (RabbitMQ, MongoDB) to the cloud (Google Cloud or another provider). For example:
Use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based MongoDB.
Run RabbitMQ on a cloud VM (like Google Compute Engine).
Alternative: Hybrid Setup
If you want to avoid exposing your local environment to the internet, you could run both solver-ms and dependent services like RabbitMQ in the cloud. Here's a hybrid option:

Keep MongoDB local (exposed via ngrok).
Run RabbitMQ and solver-ms in the cloud (in either Google Cloud Run or Google Compute Engine).
Frontend and other microservices stay local but interact with cloud services.
Summary
You only need to push the solver-ms image to Google Cloud Run.
The local services (RabbitMQ, MongoDB, etc.) need to be exposed publicly (using tools like ngrok or a static IP) so that solver-ms can communicate with them.
If handling this gets too complex, you can consider moving more services to the cloud gradually.
Would you like help setting up ngrok or further clarification on any of these steps?






You said:
Okay lets do it like this tell me the steps from start on what to do exactly
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To run only the solver-ms service on Google Cloud Run and connect it to your locally hosted services (like RabbitMQ and MongoDB), you’ll need to follow these steps:

Overview of Steps
Expose your locally running RabbitMQ and MongoDB services using ngrok.
Modify the solver-ms code to use the ngrok URLs for these services.
Build and push the solver-ms Docker image to Google Container Registry.
Deploy the solver-ms service to Google Cloud Run.
Test the setup to ensure everything works correctly.
Step 1: Expose RabbitMQ and MongoDB Using ngrok
Install ngrok: If you don’t already have ngrok installed, download it here and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Expose RabbitMQ: Assuming RabbitMQ is running locally on port 5672 (based on your Docker Compose file), expose it to the internet:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5672
This will give you a public URL like https://<random-string>.ngrok.io for RabbitMQ.
Note down this URL; you’ll need it for the next steps.
Expose MongoDB: Similarly, expose MongoDB, which is running on port 27017:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 27017
You’ll get another public URL like https://<random-string>.ngrok.io.
Note down this URL too.
Access RabbitMQ and MongoDB Credentials:

If RabbitMQ requires a username and password (as specified in your Docker Compose), keep those credentials ready.
Step 2: Modify solver-ms to Use ngrok URLs
You need to ensure that the solver-ms service on Google Cloud Run can connect to RabbitMQ and MongoDB using the public ngrok URLs.

Edit the Environment Variables in solver-ms:

Modify the solver-ms service to read the RabbitMQ and MongoDB URLs from environment variables.
Update solver.js: In solver.js, make sure RabbitMQ and MongoDB URLs are using environment variables. You might have something like this already:

javascript
Copy code
const rabbitmq = process.env.RABBITMQ_URL;
const mongoUrl = process.env.MONGO_URL;
When deploying to Cloud Run, you will set these URLs to the ngrok public URLs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

Step 3: Build and Push solver-ms Docker Image
Navigate to the solver-ms directory (where the Dockerfile for solver-ms is located).

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms .
Replace <your-project-id> with your Google Cloud Project ID.

Push the image to Google Container Registry:

bash
Copy code
docker push gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms
Step 4: Deploy solver-ms to Google Cloud Run
Now that your solver-ms Docker image is in Google Container Registry, you can deploy it to Google Cloud Run.

Deploy the service using the ngrok URLs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB:

bash
Copy code
gcloud run deploy solver-ms \
  --image gcr.io/<your-project-id>/solver-ms \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars RABBITMQ_URL=https://<your-rabbitmq-ngrok-url> \
  --set-env-vars MONGO_URL=https://<your-mongo-ngrok-url> \
  --set-env-vars RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=<rabbitmq-user> \
  --set-env-vars RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=<rabbitmq-password>
Replace:

<your-project-id> with your Google Cloud Project ID.
<your-rabbitmq-ngrok-url> with the RabbitMQ ngrok public URL.
<your-mongo-ngrok-url> with the MongoDB ngrok public URL.
<rabbitmq-user> and <rabbitmq-password> with your RabbitMQ credentials.
Allow unauthenticated access for testing. You can secure it later.

Step 5: Test the Setup
Access the solver-ms URL:

Google Cloud Run will provide a public URL for the solver-ms service. This URL should be able to communicate with the ngrok-exposed RabbitMQ and MongoDB services running locally.
Send Requests:

Trigger the RabbitMQ queue (from your locally running microservices or manually) and verify that the solver-ms service on Cloud Run can consume messages and process them using the locally hosted MongoDB.
Monitor Logs:

You can view logs in the Google Cloud Console to see if there are any issues with the service.
Run the following command to view logs:
bash
Copy code
gcloud logs read --platform run
Important Notes
ngrok URLs change each time you restart it. You’ll need to update the URLs in Cloud Run when that happens, unless you subscribe to ngrok's paid plan, which offers static URLs.
For a more permanent solution, consider running RabbitMQ and MongoDB on cloud infrastructure if you want more reliability without using ngrok.
Next Steps (Optional)
Secure Your Services:
You can add authentication and authorization to your Cloud Run service, or restrict access based on API keys if needed.

You have two options for running ngrok: either install it directly on your machine or run it inside Docker. Both methods work, but here are the differences:

1. Running ngrok as a Download (Locally Installed)
This is the traditional way of using ngrok. You download the ngrok executable and run it directly on your system.

Advantages:
Easier to set up and run without needing Docker.
Direct command-line usage.
More control over configuring ngrok options.
Steps:
Download ngrok from here and follow the instructions to install it for your operating system.
Once installed, you can expose RabbitMQ or MongoDB with commands like:
bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5672  # Expose RabbitMQ
ngrok http 27017 # Expose MongoDB
2. Running ngrok in Docker
You can also run ngrok in a Docker container if you prefer to keep things containerized.

Advantages:
No need to install anything on your local system beyond Docker.
Keep ngrok in sync with the rest of your Docker-based environment.
Steps:
Run RabbitMQ ngrok Tunnel in Docker: You can pull and run the ngrok image directly from Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm -p 4040:4040 ngrok/ngrok http rabbitmq:5672
This command will expose RabbitMQ running locally in your rabbitmq container. You can replace rabbitmq:5672 with host.docker.internal:5672 to point ngrok to the correct local RabbitMQ instance if necessary.

Run MongoDB ngrok Tunnel in Docker: Similarly, for MongoDB, you can expose it via Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm -p 4041:4040 ngrok/ngrok http mongodb:27017
Get ngrok Public URLs: Once ngrok is running in Docker, you can access its public URLs via the ngrok dashboard:

Visit http://localhost:4040 (or the port you mapped) to see the assigned public ngrok URLs.
Which Option to Choose?
If you want simplicity and ease of use, installing ngrok directly on your local machine is faster and easier.
If you prefer keeping everything containerized (since your other services are in Docker), using ngrok in Docker might fit better into your workflow.
Recommendation:
For your school project, I'd recommend installing ngrok directly (option 1). It's quick to set up and works well for short-term projects like this.

Let me know which option you prefer, and I can help you with the detailed setup!

But i was thinking because i am using microservices architecture and i wabt to run the website using docker maybe the docker option is better. What do you think?

You're absolutely right! Since you're using a microservices architecture with Docker and plan to run the entire website within Docker, it makes sense to keep everything containerized, including ngrok. This approach provides several benefits:

Advantages of Running ngrok in Docker for Your Project:
Consistency: Everything is containerized, including ngrok, which keeps your project setup consistent and easy to manage.
Isolation: Running ngrok in Docker keeps it isolated from your local machine, avoiding potential conflicts.
Ease of Deployment: When moving to the cloud or sharing the project with others, containerizing all services, including ngrok, ensures the setup is portable and works the same everywhere.
Setting Up ngrok in Docker
Here’s how you can integrate ngrok with your existing Docker Compose setup:

Step 1: Add ngrok to Your docker-compose.yml
You can add ngrok as another service to your existing Docker Compose file to expose RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

Modify your existing docker-compose.yml like this:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.9'

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.4
    container_name: mongo
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    networks:
      - app-network
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    container_name: rabbitmq
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: user
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password
    networks:
      - app-network

  # Add ngrok for RabbitMQ
  ngrok-rabbitmq:
    image: wernight/ngrok
    command: ngrok tcp rabbitmq:5672
    ports:
      - "4040:4040"  # For ngrok dashboard
    networks:
      - app-network

  # Add ngrok for MongoDB
  ngrok-mongo:
    image: wernight/ngrok
    command: ngrok tcp mongo:27017
    ports:
      - "4041:4040"  # Separate dashboard for MongoDB ngrok
    networks:
      - app-network

  front-end:
    container_name: front-end-react
    restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./front-end
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8448:3000"
    networks:
      - app-network

  edit-view-run-ms:
    container_name: edit-view-run-ms
    restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./edit-view-run-ms
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4000:7000"
    env_file:
      - ./edit-view-run-ms/.env
    networks:
      - app-network

  login-ms:
    container_name: login-ms
    restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./login-ms
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4001:7001"
    env_file:
      - ./login-ms/.env
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq
    networks:
      - app-network

  view-results-ms:
    container_name: view-results-ms
    restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./view-results-ms
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4002:7002"
    env_file:
      - ./view-results-ms/.env
    networks:
      - app-network

  solver-ms:
    container_name: solver-ms
    restart: unless-stopped
    build:
      context: ./solver-ms
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  mongo-data:

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
Explanation of Changes:
ngrok-rabbitmq: This service runs ngrok and exposes RabbitMQ (port 5672). The command tells ngrok to expose RabbitMQ using TCP.
ngrok-mongo: Similarly, this service exposes MongoDB (port 27017) through ngrok.
Ports: We exposed the ngrok web interface (dashboard) at ports 4040 and 4041 to monitor RabbitMQ and MongoDB traffic.
Step 2: Run Docker Compose
Now, simply run your docker-compose.yml file with the new services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command will start all your services, including RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and both ngrok services.

Step 3: Get the ngrok Public URLs
Visit http://localhost:4040 to see the public URL for RabbitMQ.
Visit http://localhost:4041 to see the public URL for MongoDB.
These URLs will look something like:

RabbitMQ: tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:<random-port>
MongoDB: tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:<random-port>
Step 4: Update Your solver-ms Environment Variables
Now, in your solver-ms service, update the environment variables to use the ngrok public URLs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

For example, if the RabbitMQ ngrok URL is tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345, use that as the RabbitMQ URL in the solver-ms service.

Step 5: Deploy solver-ms to Google Cloud Run
After updating the environment variables, follow the steps to build and deploy solver-ms to Google Cloud Run (as we discussed before), using the ngrok URLs for RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

Advantages of this Approach:
Dockerized Setup: All services, including ngrok, are running in Docker, which aligns with your microservices architecture.
Easy to Share: By using Docker Compose, anyone can spin up the entire environment, including ngrok, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and the solver service.
Scalability: If you want to move more services to the cloud in the future, you can do so without changing the architecture drastically.
Final Thoughts:
Using ngrok in Docker fits well with your microservices architecture and makes it easier to manage and deploy your entire setup. Once this is working, you’ll have a seamless development environment that is containerized and portable.
